## Go Lang Text Editor

On my journey to follow these projects and learn how to build these projects. https://austinhenley.com/blog/challengingprojects.html

I am starting out with the Text Editor.
From the information we have I am starting with a plan of how to build this.

Plan:
 - Research Data structures
 - Doing Piece Table `DONE`
   - Creating a Piece Table data structure `DONE`
   - Creating a Piece Table `DONE`
   - Converting away from Piece Table `DONE`
   - Inserting into Piece Table `DONE`
   - Deleting Text `DONE`
 - Figure out UX and Cursor
   - Add cursor structure
   - Create Editor and Piece Table interface
   - Add some UI (Just grab a library?)
   - Implement logic loop
   - Add tracking of location?
   - Do we want to consider a scroll?
 - Undo and redo? (Should be just remove from piece table and store and then readd to piece table?)
 - Yes, add more.

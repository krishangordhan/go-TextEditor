## Go Lang Text Editor

On my journey to follow these projects and learn how to build these projects. https://austinhenley.com/blog/challengingprojects.html

I am starting out with the Text Editor.
From the information we have I am starting with a plan of how to build this.

Plan:
 - Research Data structures
 - Doing Piece Table
   - Creating a Piece Table data structure
   - Creating a Piece Table
   - Converting away from Piece Table
   - Inserting into Piece Table
   - Deleting Text
 - Figure out UX
 - Figure out cursor
 - Undo and redo? (Should be just remove from piece table and store and then readd to piece table?)
 - Yes, add more.
